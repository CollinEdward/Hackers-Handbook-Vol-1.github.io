## What is an Operating System (OS)? 🤔

An operating system (OS) is the vital software component that comes into action on your computer once it's powered up. It's like the conductor of an orchestra, coordinating various software and hardware components to make everything run smoothly. Operating systems often have familiar names like Windows, macOS, or Linux. While Linux is technically a kernel, it's often colloquially referred to as an operating system due to its comprehensive software ecosystem.

Operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and Android, serve as the bridge between users and their devices. They enable us to interact with applications such as MS Office, Notepad, web browsers, games, and countless others on our computers and mobile devices. Even to access basic applications like web browsers, a functioning operating system is essential.
